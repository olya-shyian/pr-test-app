## In addition to the initial requirements, the following features were also implemented:

- Ability to delete a Todo.

- Ability to edit a Todo (requires 2 clicks on the Todo).

- Implemented a 100-character limit for Todo title (according to requirement: A new record is added if its length is less than or equal to N characters); otherwise, an error is displayed.

- Also, the data is stored in the localStorage, so the data persists even after the page is refreshed.

- Display a counter of completed and uncompleted tasks (the counter is displayed when selecting Completed or Current Todos)
